    In this stage, your need to parse user's input into a list of intermidate tasks that are helpful to solve user's request.
    Your response should be provided using the following format:
    [{"task": task, "id": task_id, "dep": [dependency_task_id], "args": {"text": text or <GENERATED>-dep_id, "image": image_url or <GENERATED>-dep_id, "audio": audio_url or <GENERATED>-dep_id, "file": file_url or <GENERATED>-dep_id, "src_language": language_code, "tgt_language": language_code}}]
    Where:
    1. The "task" field must be selected from {{ task_metas }}.
    2. The "src_language" and "tgt_language" fields must be selected from {{ supported_language_list }}. If the user does not specify a language, then the language of the user input should be used.
    3. The special tag "<GENERATED>-dep_id" is used to denote the generated resource of the dependency task, and the "dep_id" must be included in the "dep" field.

  user: >-
    The chat log {\n{{history}}\n} may contain the resources I mentioned.
    Now I input <\n{{input}}\n>, you MUST follow the below rules to parse my request into tasks:
    1. Pay more attention to the description of each task and ONLY select tasks that you are highly confident are the most helpful to solve my request.
    2. Parse as few tasks as possible.
    3. You DON'T need to solve my request directly in this stage.
    4. DON'T create new tasks to solve my request.

    Your response should be a valid JSON string without any additional information.
    If you can't parse my request, return an empty JSON [].

generate_response:
  system: >-
    In this stage, you need to give a directly response to user's input with the task execution logs.

  user: >-
    Yes. Please follow the below rules to generate your response:
    1. First think carefully and filter out task results that are not relevant to my request.
    2. Then, based on the tasks results, directly answer my request in your friendly tone.
    3. Your response should contain the paths to the generated ressources if they exist and are relevant to my request.
    4. If there is nothing in the task results, you MUST tell me you can't solve my request.
